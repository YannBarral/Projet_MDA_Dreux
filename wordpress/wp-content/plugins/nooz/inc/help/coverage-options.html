<h3 id="press-coverage-options">Press Coverage Options</h3>
<p>The Press Coverage tab contains options to modify the behavior of the press coverage list.</p>
<p><strong>URL</strong></p>
<p>This is the permalink of the press coverage page. Take care when changing this option as it will affect page and feed links. Your <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Optimization#Caching" target="_blank">cache</a> may need to be cleared when changing this option.</p>
<p><strong>Featured Image</strong></p>
<p>This is the default featured image that will appear if one is not added for a press coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Link Target</strong></p>
<p>By default press coverage links will open in a new browser window when clicked (e.g. <code>_blank</code>). Removing this value will disable this option.</p>
